Dataset: Default of Credit Card Clients — UCI Machine Learning Repository

Introductory Paper: Yeh & Lien (2009)

Dataset Overview
This research examines customer default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of the probability of default across six data mining methods.

From a risk management perspective, predicting the probability of default is more valuable than a binary classification (credible vs. not credible). Because the true probability of default is unknown, the study introduces a novel Sorting Smoothing Method to estimate it.

Using the estimated probability of default as the target variable (Y) and the predicted probability from each model as the explanatory variable (X), a simple linear regression model (Y = A + B*X) was fitted. Among the six models tested, artificial neural networks achieved:

Highest coefficient of determination (R²)

Regression intercept (A) close to 0

Regression coefficient (B) close to 1
